#Create docker instance for a server application that will host the created python script Airline_booking.py

#The application is just backend and no front end has been developed yet.

#The idea is to get the flight booking app to run and can scale using load balance methodology as taught my Sir Vimal in IIEC docker.

#The script will be accessed from an outside Network hence we will enable PAT and NAT from local host computer to RHEL8 instance hosting docker container.

#the script should run as required by confirm a booking on a flight system.

#improvement of script for future use
